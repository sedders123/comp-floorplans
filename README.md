# Student Robotics Competition Floor Plans

Floor plans for the Student Robotics competition. These are maintained by the Production Manager <production-manager@studentrobotics.org>.

They serve four important purposes:

 1. Indicate how the arena and pits should be laid out.
 1. Indicate where power and network points are required.
 1. Provide a map of the venue, with team locations marked on.
 1. Indicate where teams are located for shepherds.

## Notes for 2014-2017

Definitely leaves enough room for fire exists, the floor plans from newbury are
[here](http://www.racecoursenewbury.co.uk/documents/Grandstand-Ground-Floor.pdf)
and
[here](http://www.racecoursenewbury.co.uk/documents/Grandstand-Second-Floor.pdf).
They're generally insane though. These are easier to work form. PNGs are
generated from SVGs. A floor plan Murray found from the planning permission
website has been included for reference.
